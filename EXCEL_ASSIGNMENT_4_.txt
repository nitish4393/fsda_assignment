Q1. To use the ribbon commands, what menu and grouping of commands will you	find the Insert and Delete command?

ANS.In Microsoft Excel, the "Insert" and "Delete" commands are commonly used actions, and they are found in the
    "Cells" group under the "Home" tab of the ribbon menu. Here's how to access them:
    Insert Command:
    To insert cells, rows, columns, or sheets, follow these steps:

	1)Go to the "Home" tab in the Excel ribbon at the top of the window.
	2)Look for the "Cells" group. 
	3)Within the "Cells" group, you will find the "Insert" button. Click on this button to 
	access the options for inserting cells, rows, columns, or sheets.
	Delete Command:

	To delete cells, rows, columns, or sheets, follow these steps:

	1)go to the "Home" tab in the Excel ribbon.
	2)Locate the "Cells" group.
	3)Within the "Cells" group, you'll find the "Delete" button.Click on this button to access the options for 
	deleting cells, rows, columns, or sheets.
	
Q2. If you set a row height or column width to 0 (zero), what happens to the row and column?

ANS.Setting a row height or column width to 0 (zero) in Excel will effectively hide the row or column. Here's what happens:

	Row Height:

	If you set the height of a row to 0, the entire row will become hidden, and its content will no longer be 
	visible in the worksheet. However, the row isn't deleted; it's just hidden from view.
	
	Column Width:

	If you set the width of a column to 0, the entire column will become hidden, and its content will no longer 
	be visible in the worksheet. As with rows, the column isn't deleted; it's hidden from view.
	While the content within the hidden rows or columns won't be visible on the worksheet, the data itself is not 
	deleted or lost. You can unhide the rows or columns at any time using Excel's "Unhide" command.
	
Q3. Is there a need to change the height and width in a cell? Why?

ANS.In Excel, you can change the height of rows and the width of columns to adjust the visual layout and formatting 
	of your spreadsheet. Here are some reasons why you might want to change the height and width of cells:

	1. Readability and Appearance:
	Adjusting row height and column width can enhance the readability and appearance of your data. You can make text 
	and numbers fit comfortably within cells without getting cut off or wrapped to the next line.

	2. Formatting and Design:
	Changing the height and width of cells can help you create a well-organized and aesthetically pleasing layout. 
	This is particularly important when designing reports, tables, or charts where visual clarity is essential.

	3. Merged Cells:
	Merging cells often requires adjusting the height and width to accommodate the merged content properly. Merged
	cells allow you to create larger cells by combining adjacent ones.

	4. Alignment and Presentation:
	Adjusting column width can help align data more effectively. For example, you might widen a column to display 
	dates or labels more prominently.

Q4. What is the keyboard shortcut to unhide rows?
ANS.In Excel, you can use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Shift + 9 to unhide rows. This shortcut is used to quickly 
	reveal any hidden rows within your worksheet. Simply select a cell in the row above and below the hidden rows, 
	and then press Ctrl + Shift + 9 simultaneously. The hidden rows in between will be displayed again.
	
Q5. How to hide rows containing blank cells?

ANS.To hide rows containing blank cells in Excel, you can use a filter to display only the rows with non-blank cells.
	Here's how you can do it:

	1)Select Your Data:
	Click on a cell within the column that you want to filter. This column should contain the data you want to check
	for blank cells.

	2)Apply a Filter:
	Go to the "Data" tab in the Excel ribbon. Click on the "Filter" button. This will add filter dropdown arrows to 
	the header of each column.

	3)Filter for Non-Blanks:
	Click on the filter dropdown arrow for the column you want to filter. In the dropdown menu, uncheck the "Blanks" 
	option. This will hide the rows with blank cells in that column.

	4)View Filtered Data:
	You will now see only the rows that have non-blank cells in the selected column. The rows with blank cells will 
	be hidden from view.

	Remember that when you use this method, only the rows with blank cells in the selected column will be hidden. 
	If you want to hide rows based on blank cells in multiple columns, you would need to apply this filtering process
	to each relevant column separately.

	Additionally, be cautious when hiding rows with important data, as filtering can change the visibility of data but 
	doesn't delete it. Hidden data can still affect calculations and other operations, so ensure that your data remains consistent with your intended use of the spreadsheet.
