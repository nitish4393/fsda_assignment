Q1. What does the dollar($) sign do?

ans=In Excel, the dollar sign ($) is used as an absolute reference in cell references.
    When you use the dollar sign in front of a column letter or row number in a cell reference, it prevents that 
    part of the reference from changing when you copy or fill the formula to other cells.

    There are two main ways to use the dollar sign in cell references:

    1)Absolute Reference: When we place a dollar sign before both the column letter and row number in a 
	cell reference, it creates an absolute reference. For example, if you have a cell reference like 
	"$A$1", both the column (A) and the row (1) will remain fixed when you copy the formula to other cells. 
	
	2)Mixed Reference: When you use the dollar sign before either the column letter or the row number, 
	but not both, it creates a mixed reference. For example, if you have a cell reference like "$A1", 
	the column (A) will remain fixed, but the row will adjust as you copy the formula vertically. Similarly, 
	if you have a reference like "A$1", the row (1) will remain fixed, but the column will adjust as you copy 
	the formula horizontally.

Q2.  How to Change the Reference from Relative to Absolute (or Mixed) in excel?

ans=To change a reference from relative to absolute or mixed in Excel, we need to use the dollar sign ($) 
    to anchor the part of the reference that you want to remain fixed. Here's how you can do it:

	a)Changing to Absolute Reference:
	
	To create an absolute reference, place a dollar sign ($) before both the column letter and the row number in the reference.

	For example, if you have a relative reference like "A1" and you want to make it an absolute reference
	Type the dollar sign ($) in front of both the column letter and the row number (e.g., "= $A$1").

	Now, the reference "A1" has become an absolute reference "$A$1," and it will not change when you copy or fill
	the formula to other cells.

	b)Changing to Mixed Reference:
	To create a mixed reference, place a dollar sign ($) before either the column letter or the row number, but not both.

	For example, if you have a relative reference like "A1" and you want to make it a mixed reference
	Type the dollar sign ($) in front of either the column letter or the row number, but not both (e.g., "= $A1" or "= A$1").

	Now, the reference "A1" has become a mixed reference, either "$A1" or "A$1," depending on where you placed the dollar sign.
	The anchored part will not change when you copy or fill the formula, while the other part will adjust based on the relative 
	position of the new cell.

Q3.explain order of operation in excel

ANS=In Excel, order of operations, also known as operator precedence, refers to the sequence in which mathematical 
	operators are evaluated in a formula. When you have multiple operators in a single formula, Excel follows a specific 
	order to perform the calculations correctly. The order of operations in Excel is as follows:

	a)Parentheses (): Excel evaluates expressions within parentheses first.The innermost expressions are evaluated first,
	followed by the outer ones.

	b)Exponents (^): Excel calculates exponents next. For example, if you have "2^3" in a formula, it will be 
	calculated as 2 raised to the power of 3, which equals 8.

	c)Multiplication (*) and Division (/): After handling parentheses and exponents, Excel performs multiplication and 
	division operations from left to right. 

	Addition (+) and Subtraction (-): Lastly, Excel performs addition and subtraction operations from left to right.
	If there are multiple addition or subtraction operators.

	Here's an example to illustrate the order of operations in Excel:

	Consider the formula: "= 10 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 / (4 + 2)"

	Parentheses: "(4 + 2)" evaluates to 6.
	Exponents: "3 ^ 2" evaluates to 9.
	Multiplication: "2 * 9" evaluates to 18.
	Division: "18 / 6" evaluates to 3.
	Addition: "10 + 3" evaluates to 13.
	So, the final result of the formula "= 10 + 2 * 3 ^ 2 / (4 + 2)" in Excel will be 13.

Q4)what according to you are the top 5 function in excel and write a basic syntax from any of two?

ANS=Excel offers a wide range of functions to perform various tasks, but here are five commonly used functions that are considered essential:

	a)SUM Function:
	Syntax: =SUM(number1, [number2], ...)

	The SUM function adds up a list of numbers. You can provide multiple numbers as input, and it will return the sum of those numbers.

	Example: Let's say you want to find the sum of values in cells A1 to A5:
    =SUM(A1:A5)

	b)VLOOKUP Function:
	Syntax: =VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])

	The VLOOKUP function is used to search for a value in the first column of a range (table_array) and return a 
	corresponding value from a different column in the same row. It is commonly used for table lookups.

	Example: Suppose you have a table in the range A1:B10 and want to find the corresponding value for the lookup 
	value in cell D1:
	=VLOOKUP(D1, A1:B10, 2, FALSE)

	c)IF Function:
	Syntax: =IF(logical_test, [value_if_true], [value_if_false])

	The IF function allows you to perform a logical test and return different values based on whether the test is true or false.
	It is useful for creating conditional statements.

	Example: If the value in cell A1 is greater than 10, return "Yes"; otherwise, return "No":
	=IF(A1 > 10, "Yes", "No")

	d)COUNT Function:
	Syntax: =COUNT(value1, [value2], ...)

	The COUNT function counts the number of cells within a specified range that contain numbers or dates. It is
	used to get the count of non-empty cells.

	Example: To count the number of cells with values in the range A1:A10:
	=COUNT(A1:A10)

	e)AVERAGE Function:
	Syntax: =AVERAGE(number1, [number2], ...)

	The AVERAGE function calculates the average of a list of numbers. It adds up the values and divides by the count of values.

	Example: To find the average of values in cells B1 to B5:
	=AVERAGE(B1:B5)

Q5.when would you use the subtotal function

ANS=The SUBTOTAL function in Excel is used to perform calculations on a range of data while providing options for ignoring hidden rows in the calculation. 
	It is particularly useful when working with filtered data or subtotals within a larger dataset. The SUBTOTAL function can perform various calculations,
	such as SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, and more, based on the values in the specified range, while excluding any rows that are hidden due to filtering.

	The syntax of the SUBTOTAL function is as follows:


	=SUBTOTAL(function_num, range1, [range2], ...)
	
	When to use the SUBTOTAL function:

	a)Working with Filtered Data: When you have a large dataset with filtering applied, and you want to perform calculations on only the visible (unfiltered) 
	data, you can use the SUBTOTAL function. Since SUBTOTAL ignores hidden rows, it ensures that your calculations are accurate and based on the currently visible data.

	b)Creating Subtotals within Groups: If you have data organized in groups or outlines (created using Excel's Group feature), you can use the SUBTOTAL function to calculate subtotals for each group. 
	
	c)Building Dynamic Summary Reports: The SUBTOTAL function is helpful when creating dynamic summary reports that allow users to change the view of data by applying filters. 
	
	d)Conditional Aggregations: If you want to calculate aggregate functions (e.g., SUM, AVERAGE) based on specific conditions or filtered criteria, you can use the SUBTOTAL function along with other logical functions like IF or COUNTIF.

Q6.What is the syntax of the vlookup function? Explain the terms in it?

ANS=The VLOOKUP function in Excel is used to search for a value in the first column of a table or range, and 
	then return a corresponding value from a different column in the same row. 

	The syntax of the VLOOKUP function is as follows:

	=VLOOKUP(lookup_value, table_array, col_index_num, [range_lookup])
	the terms used in the VLOOKUP function:

	a)lookup_value: This is the value you want to search for in the first column of the table or range (table_array). 
	It can be a value, cell reference, or another formula that returns a single value.

	b)table_array: This is the range of cells that contains the data you want to search through. The VLOOKUP function 
	looks for the lookup_value in the first column of this range. 
	
	c)col_index_num: This is the column number in the table_array from which you want to return the result. 
	For example, if the data you need is in the second column of the table_array, you would enter "2" as the col_index_num.
	
	d)range_lookup (optional): This is a logical value that specifies whether you want an exact match or an approximate match for the lookup_value. 
	This parameter is optional, and if omitted, it defaults to TRUE (or 1). If set to TRUE, VLOOKUP performs an approximate match using the closest 
	value that is less than or equal to the lookup_value. If set to FALSE (or 0), VLOOKUP performs an exact match.
