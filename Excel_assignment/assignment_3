Q1). How and when to use the AutoSum command in excel?
ans) The AutoSum command in Excel is used to quickly calculate the sum of a range of numbers. It's a convenient way 
     to perform basic calculations without manually entering formulas.

	Here's how to use the AutoSum command:

	Step 1: Select the cell where you want the sum to appear.
	Step 2: Click on the "AutoSum" button in the "Editing" group on the "Home" tab. The AutoSum button looks like 
	Sigma (âˆ‘).
	Step 3: Excel will automatically select a range of cells above or to the left of the active cell that it thinks 
	you want to sum. If the selection is correct, press Enter to confirm and calculate the sum.
	
	When to Use AutoSum:

	AutoSum is most useful when you need to quickly calculate the sum of a range of numbers without the need to
	write a separate SUM formula. It's particularly used for small calculations or when you're working with simple 
	datasets. 
	
Q2). What is the shortcut key to perform AutoSum?

ANS) The shortcut key to perform AutoSum in Excel is:

	"Alt" + "="

	Pressing "Alt" and "=" simultaneously will activate the AutoSum function for the selected cell. 
	Excel will automatically try to determine the range of cells to sum based on the data around the active cell, 
	and you can press Enter to confirm the selection and calculate the sum. If the automatic selection is not correct, 
	you can adjust the range manually before pressing Enter
	
Q3) How do you get rid of Formula that omits adjacent cells?

ANS) If you have a formula in Excel that is omitting adjacent cells and you want to include those cells in the 
	 calculation, you'll need to adjust the formula to the desired range. Here's how to do it:

	1)Edit the Formula:

	Double-click on the cell containing the formula to enter the edit mode. Alternatively, you can select the 
	cell and then click on the formula bar at the top of the Excel window.

	2)Adjust the Range:

	Locate the part of the formula that specifies the range of cells being used. This could be a range reference 
	(like A1:A10) or a function that references a range (like SUM(A1:A10)). Modify the range to include the adjacent 
	cells you want to include in the calculation.

	3)Press Enter:

	After adjusting the formula, press Enter to confirm the changes. Excel will recalculate the formula with the 
	updated range.

	4)Check the Result:

	Verify that the formula now includes the adjacent cells and produces the correct result.

	For example, if you have a formula like =SUM(A1:A5) and you want to include adjacent cells A6 and A7, you 
	can adjust the formula to =SUM(A1:A7).
	
Q4) How do you select non-adjacent cells in Excel 2016?

ANS)In Excel 2016, you can select non-adjacent cells by holding down the "Ctrl" (Control) key on your keyboard 
	while clicking on the individual cells you want to select. Here's how to do it:

	1)Select a Single Cell:
	Click on a cell to select it.

	2)Select Multiple Non-Adjacent Cells:
	Hold down the "Ctrl" key on your keyboard.

	3)Click on Additional Cells:
	While holding down the "Ctrl" key, click on the other cells you want to select. Each cell you click on 
	will be added to the selection.

	4)Release the "Ctrl" Key:
	Once you've selected all the non-adjacent cells you need, you can release the "Ctrl" key.

	The selected cells will now appear highlighted, indicating that they are part of the selection. You can then
	perform various actions on the selected cells, such as formatting, copying, cutting, or applying functions.
	
Q5) What happens if you choose a column, hold down the Alt key and press the letters
	ocw in quick succession?
ANS)In Microsoft Excel, if you choose a column, hold down the "Alt" key, and press the letters "ocw" in quick succession,
    you are activating a series of keyboard shortcuts to manipulate the column. Each letter corresponds to a specific action:

    "o" (Column Width): Holding down the "Alt" key and pressing "o" opens the "Column Width" dialog box. This 
	allows you to adjust the width of the selected column by entering a specific value.

    "c" (AutoFit Column Width): After the "Column Width" dialog box is open, pressing "c" (while still holding
	the "Alt" key) automatically adjusts the selected column's width to fit the content within it using the "AutoFit 
	Column Width" feature.

    "w" (Hide Column): After the "AutoFit Column Width" action, pressing "w" (while still holding the "Alt" key)
	hides the selected column.

    In summary, if you choose a column, hold down the "Alt" key, and press the letters "ocw" in quick succession, 
	you'll first open the "Column Width" dialog box, then automatically adjust the column width to fit the content, 
	and finally, hide the selected column. This sequence of actions can be useful for quickly adjusting and managing
	column widths and visibility.


Q6) If you right-click on a row reference number and click on Insert, where will the row
	be added?

ANS)If you right-click on a row reference number (the number on the left-hand side of the Excel worksheet representing each row) 
	and then click on "Insert," the new row will be added directly above the row you right-clicked on.
	For example, if you right-click on row 5 and choose to insert a new row, a new row will be inserted between rows 4 and 5.
	The content of the existing rows will shift down to accommodate the new row.This is a convenient way to add a 
	row above the current location without the need to manually adjust the content and formatting of the rows yourself.
