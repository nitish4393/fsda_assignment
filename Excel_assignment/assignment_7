Q2. What is AutoFit and why do we use it?
ANS.In Microsoft Excel, you can select columns and rows using various methods, depending on your preference and the specific task you're performing.
	Here are the different ways you can select columns and rows:

	a)Mouse Selection:

	Select a Column: Click on the column header letter (e.g., "A," "B," etc.). The entire column will be selected.
	Select a Row: Click on the row number (e.g., "1," "2," etc.). The entire row will be selected.
	Select Multiple Columns or Rows: Click and drag your mouse across the column headers or row numbers to select multiple columns or rows.
	
	b)Keyboard Shortcuts:

	Select a Column: Press the "Ctrl" key and the "Spacebar" key simultaneously. The entire column containing the active cell will be selected.
	Select a Row: Press the "Shift" key and the "Spacebar" key simultaneously. The entire row containing the active cell will be selected.
	
	c)Selecting Non-Contiguous Columns or Rows:

	Hold down the "Ctrl" key (or "Cmd" key on Mac) while clicking on the column headers or row numbers you want to select. This allows you to 
	select multiple non-contiguous columns or rows.
	
	d)Selecting Entire Worksheet Columns and Rows:

	Select Entire Column: Click the box at the intersection of the column header and row header (where "A" and "1" intersect). This will select the entire column.
	Select Entire Row: Click the box at the intersection of the column header and row header (where "A" and "1" intersect). This will select the entire row.
	
	e)Using the "Name Box" for Selection:

	The "Name Box" is the box located next to the formula bar that displays the active cell's reference (e.g., "A1"). You can manually enter a cell 
	reference (e.g., "B3:B10") and press "Enter" to select the corresponding range of cells.
	
	f)Using Excel's Ribbon:

	On the "Home" tab, you'll find the "Editing" group with options like "Find & Select." Clicking the drop-down arrow here provides additional options, 
	such as selecting specific types of data or selecting visible cells.
	
	g)Using Ctrl + Shift + Arrow Keys:

	Pressing "Ctrl + Shift" and then an arrow key (up, down, left, or right) will extend the selection of cells in that direction until it reaches a blank cell.
	
	h)Using Excel's "Go To" Feature:

	Press "Ctrl + G" or "F5" to open the "Go To" dialog box. You can enter a specific range (e.g., "B2:C10") to select columns and rows within that range.
	
	i)Using Tables:

	If your data is organized into Excel tables, you can click on the table's filter dropdowns to select specific columns based on the data's content.
	
Q3.
ANS.AutoFit is a feature in Microsoft Excel that automatically adjusts the width of columns or the height of rows to fit the content within them. 
	This feature is useful when the content in a cell exceeds the visible width or height of the cell, causing some content to be hidden. AutoFit ensures that all the content is visible without manual resizing.

	1)Here's how AutoFit works for columns and rows:

	i)AutoFit Column Width:

	When you apply AutoFit to a column, Excel adjusts the width of the column to fit the longest piece of content within that column. This is particularly
	useful when you have text, numbers, or dates that are wider than the default column width.
	
	ii)AutoFit Row Height:

	Applying AutoFit to a row adjusts the height of the row to accommodate the tallest content in that row. This is helpful when you have wrapped text or 
	multiple lines of text within a cell.
	
	2)Reasons for Using AutoFit:

	i)Visibility: AutoFit ensures that all the content in a cell is fully visible, preventing any text or data from being cut off or hidden due to insufficient
	column width or row height.

	ii)Professional Presentation: When you're creating reports, charts, or tables for presentation, using AutoFit helps maintain a neat and polished appearance
	by aligning content within cells properly.

	iii)Efficiency: AutoFit saves time by automatically adjusting column widths or row heights, reducing the need for manual adjustments.

	iv)Text Wrapping: If you have text wrapping enabled within cells, AutoFit ensures that the wrapped text is visible without manual adjustments.

	v)Consistency: When you're working with large datasets, using AutoFit consistently across columns and rows can help maintain a consistent appearance and readability throughout the spreadsheet.

	3)How to Use AutoFit:

	i)AutoFit Column Width:

	To apply AutoFit to a single column, double-click the right edge of the column header. Alternatively, right-click the column header and choose "AutoFit Column Width."
	To apply AutoFit to multiple selected columns, right-click on any selected column header and choose "AutoFit Selection."
	
	ii)AutoFit Row Height:

	To apply AutoFit to a single row, double-click the bottom edge of the row header. This works best when you have wrapped text.
	To apply AutoFit to multiple selected rows, right-click on any selected row header and choose "Row Height."
	
Q4. How can you insert new rows and columns into the existing table?
ANS.In Microsoft Excel, you can easily insert new rows and columns into an existing table. Tables in Excel are dynamic ranges of data that adjust automatically 	
	when you add or remove rows or columns. Here's how you can insert new rows and columns into an existing table:

	A)Inserting New Rows:
	Method 1: Using the "Insert" Menu:

	Right-click on a row within the table where you want to insert new rows.
	From the context menu, select "Insert" and then choose "Table Rows Above" or "Table Rows Below" to insert new rows accordingly.
	Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut:

	Select a row within the table.
	Press "Ctrl" + "+" (plus key) to insert a new row above the selected row.
	
	B)Inserting New Columns:
	Method 1: Using the "Insert" Menu:

	Right-click on a column header within the table where you want to insert new columns.
	From the context menu, select "Insert" and then choose "Table Columns to the Left" or "Table Columns to the Right" to insert new columns accordingly.
	Method 2: Keyboard Shortcut:

	Select a column within the table.
	Press "Ctrl" + "+" (plus key) to insert a new column to the left of the selected column.
	
Q5. How do you hide and unhide columns in excel?

	you want to focus on specific data or when you need to temporarily conceal certain information. Here's how you can hide and unhide columns:

	Hiding Columns:

	Method 1: Right-Click Context Menu:
